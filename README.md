# sandiego_garage
Garage app.

Started this project when I was just 2 month into programming journey. There are many thing wrong, I didnt follow the rules because I didnt know them.
Well now I do and this code needs a major refactor. The idea to make this 'APP' was from the realtive of mine, who has his own business as car mechanic.

It has almost every car brand and its models in database. Saves clients, and cars assiociated to them. Every repair is saved to every car with its prices and dates.
I guess there is A LOT to improve but it is made to meet the satisfaction of my cousin, every backend feature is like he wanted it to be to make it simple yet effective.
Major feature i want to implement is to send SMS to clients when their oil change is up to replace (and many other remionders for clients).

Dont judge the frontend side, im not an artistic mind and I just don't like frontend stuff, CSS and HTML are interesting but i love the magic of backend.

The description in two langs is avaiable on the site, you can read it, log in and check fro urself about the features.
